    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>I develop games as a hobby.<br>
    I am currently working on an escape game.<br>
    When creating games, I aim to provide experiences that allow players to think and enjoy themselves at the same time.<br>
    I’m still learning, but I would be thrilled if many people could enjoy my games.</p>

    <h2>To those who have played my game:</h2>
    <p>Thank you so much for playing!<br>
    If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to let me know.<br>
    I’m eager to use your feedback to create even more enjoyable games.<br>
    I’m currently developing new games, so I hope you’ll try them out in the future as well!</p>
